### The Beginning of Cleanify

Cleanify Design was emerged, in a start, from the need to have a framework that mix [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [One UI](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/one-ui/) style.

As I don't find anything similar to this... I decide to make my own framework.

The first time, Cleanify was going to be a fork of bootstrap adapted for look as OneUI, but that idea was going to last shortly.

Then, the idea came out in a meeting with friends... Why not make my own framework from scratch?

And, here we go... An HTML, CSS & JS framework made from scratch based on both styles that I needed.

The first version was released and Cleanify Design was saw the light for first time.

With this in mind, the big second version was started developed.

This time many things were modified. From the organization of GitHub repository until a new and improved style for the framework.

The second version is here and you can watch all the new features and changes that I was made from the first version. As the new banners!
